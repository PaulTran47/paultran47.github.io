<div class="ref-box">

	<p>
    	<span class="firstcharacter">W</span>ith my first competition only two months away from now, I've been focusing more on form than sheer weight, especially when talking about the deadlift. I've been working on pulling with a more neutral back and braced core, which makes it much easier for me to lock out my pulls when the weight becomes heavier. I used to pull with a slightly rounded upper back, which had no issue in terms of endangering myself, but did make it harder for me to lock out at the end (although it did allow for the weights to come off the floor at a quicker speed than now).
