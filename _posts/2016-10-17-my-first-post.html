    	<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> have never blogged in my life before. Until recently, the idea of blogging had never entered my mind, especially when accounting for how busy I am as an undergraduate student at Pomona College. But I've realised that my experiences as a student, and the things I have accomplished as a student, both give me a lot to say and share to the audience that is the internet. So, here it is; my first ever blog, and my first ever blog post.

		So hi, I'm Paul! This blog will really be an index of records of my thoughts, of my personal journey in powerlifting, and of any interesting and cool things that I want to share to you all. Think of it as a one-sided conversation, where it's me doing all the talking, and you doing all the listening. Of course, I'm kidding, because I'd love for you guys to shoot me an email if you'd like to respond to any of my posts, or if you'd like to talk about other matters.

	<p>It's great to have you here!</p>

		P.S. To understand why I say, "Hi, I'm Paul" so much, search that phrase on YouTube or Google in general. You will get the nostalgic feels if you understand.<br />

		P.S.S. I do not own the content that you will discover by doing what I suggested above. The content, all copyrights, and all rights in general are owned by DNA Productions solely. I am only stating it for entertainment purposes.
