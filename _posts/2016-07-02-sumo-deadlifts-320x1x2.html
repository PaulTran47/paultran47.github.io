    	<span class="firstcharacter">T</span>oday felt like a bad day. I was exhausted, I was mentally stressed, and I was hungry. I really wanted to be able to pull 320x1x5, but the second rep felt as if 320 pounds was actually 380 pounds.<br />

   		Everyone is going to have bad days. It's inevitable that days are going to come where it feels like nothing in one's workout routine is going well. It's even possible that one's warm-ups will already begin to feel too heavy. The only thing I can say about handling bad days is to just finish what you can, and relax. There's no point in fussing over a bad day (something I still do to this day; old habits die hard), since such fussing will only increase one's mental stress, and therefore increase the chance of more bad days to come.<br />

   		It might be easier said than done, but remember that at the end of the day, powerlifting is one of the few sports that is truly individual; one's success and failures is all due to oneself. Because of that, it's probably the case that you will be the person that cares the most about your lifts. Why bother making yourself frustrated when you're lifting for yourself?<br />

   		<strong>Lift happy!</strong>
