    	<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> must admit: Conventional deadlifting is painful. Though I love it and personally find it more impressive than sumo deadlifting, I believe the reason why I think this way is because conventional deadlifting is just so difficult for me. I feel the strain and the struggle whenever I attempt conventional deadlifting, even though the same weight feels much lighter whilst sumo deadlifting.<br />

    	With this in mind, I'm quite happy with my performance today of 320x1x5; my back wasn't too rounded, my lock-outs were strong; and the speed wasn't bad at all. Overall, a good deadlifting day!
