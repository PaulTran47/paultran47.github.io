        <p>Pretty proud moment in my powerlifting journey; because this was posted back in May of 2016 (via Instagram), it's best to provide some context. 315 pounds has always been a big goal of mine when it came to deadlifting; it just seemed amazing to be able to deadlift three plates (each plate is 45 pounds). Since this was before I knew of the existence of sumo deadlifting, this moment is considered a personal milestone in my lifting career, as I managed to achieve my goal through conventional deadlifting (which is so bloody hard!).</p>
