title: First Max Test

<div class="ref-box">

	<p>
    	<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> had my first max test today! I'm actually quite pleased with my results, especially for squat. Though my squat:deadlift ratio is quite pathetic, I'm happy with how my squat max was over 225 pounds, since I've gone through two injuries (one shoulder-related and one ankle-related) that put my squat behind deadlifting. With a total of 840 points, I'm pretty excited at the idea that getting a 1,000 pounds total when I compete for the first time next spring is an actual reachable goal. I just have to work my bench up first...
