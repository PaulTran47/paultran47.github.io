title: Why Did I Choose Jekyll?
---

<span class="firstcharacter">J</span>ekyll Generates Static Websites. Static websites are popular because they are super efficient, extremely fast and usually free to host. Blogs, resumes, marketing websites, landing pages, and documentation are all good candidates for static websites. To understand the differences and benefits of static vs dynamic websites, follow this quick visual tutorial:

Well, I guess it's quite obvious that I really enjoy working with Jekyll — with good reasons — so let me just briefly suggest some of the benefits of using a static site generator in favor of a heavy dynamic, database driven content management system.

- **Speed**: Static HTML pages are small, lightweight and perform blazingly fast. You’ll notice the difference. Static websites serve content directly from
the web-server's file-system exactly as stored. Static File Servers are extremely fast, can handle tons of traffic, and fail much less often.

- **Version Control**: Contents and files remain on your computer. Perform backups or keep track of changes via GIT or SVN — *it’s quite easy without a database.*

- **Flexibility**: Ruby and Liquid — *Jekyll’s foundation* — empower you to easily extend its functionality. Or just use one of [many plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/) created by a striving community.

- **Security**: Anything you’ll ever put on your server are static files — chances are good that *you’ll never need to worry* about security concerns anymore.

If that still doesn’t convince you to at least give it a try, I’d like to encourage you to head over to the [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/) and see it for yourself.

Jekyll Blogs are cool because:

- Create content in markdown or textile.
- Manage everything with git.
- Publish from terminal.
- No database.
- No hosting headaches.
- Data and websites are secured due to no database.
- Did I mention your websites and blog are fast?

**It's everything you could want from WordPress, and then some**

I'm glad I chose Jekyll from the get-go. I definitely don't see myself switching away from it.
