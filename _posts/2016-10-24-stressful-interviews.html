    	<span class="firstcharacter">B</span>eing a fourth year at Pomona College who is over a quarter through his final undergraduate year, I must admit that the element of solidifying what you will be doing after graduating is quite stressful. Specifically, it's stressful to balance both my academic performance in upper division courses and, in my case, my preparation when it comes to job search. I have already crossed the first big obstacle for my post-undergraduate life by deciding to gain either work or research experience first and foremost. However, there doesn't seem to have any moment for rest in the next step of finding actual experience. Be it polishing your resume/CV, your social skills, and your portfolio, probably the thing that makes me most anxious is preparing for interviews.

    	Now, I know I can talk well with people; I would think that's one of the main reasons why I get along with my friends, peers, and co-workers. Furthermore, I know that being interviewed is just the interviewer's moment to find out more about me, and to have a conversation with me. I know this, and I know that I speak normally and professionally in all instances of interviews. But it doesn't change the fact that interviews are stressful. This is because I always have the thought in the back of my head that this interview is a chance for the interviewer to size me up, and to see how my skills and personality fit in terms of the company's culture and environment. It also doesn't help that interviews are often a stage of the job process that can make or break your application itself with a company.

    	I think having this thought in the back of your head is always good; it keeps you on your toes during all questions and interactions, and it makes sure you are on your best game when presenting your skills and personality. However, I think interviewing can be less stressful if you take action to make it less stressful in your mind. Specifically, you should always try to think, first and foremost, that an interview is merely a conversation opportunity between you and the intervieer. By thinking that it's a chance for you to talk about yourself and about interesting topics related to the position, this mindset will allow for you to actually relax, or even better, to convert that anxiety to excitement. In essence, I believe treating an interview as a conversation you're excited to have is the best way to make an interview less stressful.<br />
    	It takes some of the pressure (but not too much!) off from your shoulders, and thus allows you to just be honest and yourself.

    	<span class="firstcharacter">Y</span>ou might be asking why I've decided to talk about my thoughts on interviews, how they're stressful for me, and how I deal with them. Because I'm currently in the last, third round of a long application and interview process for a company I'm excited about possibly working with, I felt it necessary for me to just tell the internet about my thoughts on the whole process. Who knows, it's possible that my take on interviewing might be helpful for another hopeful applicant like myself. I hope I get this job!
