    	<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> have officianlly fallen into a rabbit hole that I think I won't ever be getting out of: I have become a fan of mechanical pencils. Being completely honest with the internet, I have never had the thought that the quality of the pencil in my hands would greatly influence the duration and comfort of my writing sessions. I have always used and kept random pencils I found lying around or on sale because they were always viewed as tools in my eyes. However, thanks to the great subreddit of r/mechanicalpencils, I've realised that mechanical pencils, like mechanical keyboards, can have a sense of beauty and refinement to them. It is now that I present my first dive into the mechanical pencil rabbit hole: The uni Kuru Toga Roulette mechanical pencil.

    	What immediately stands out to me is the overall build and aesthetic qualities. The knurling at the base of the pencil can be described as a bit aggressive to some, but I personally find it comfortable and very reliable whenever my fingers get slippery from sweat. Though some parts of the pencil are made of plastic, it doesn't seem flimsy at all, so that isn't a personal issue for me (though I definitely understand how this can be a turn-off for many). However, the thing about this pencil that caught my attention the most was the internal mechanism, and also its main selling point, of the pencil. Because of internal gears, whenever one lifts and puts pressure onto the tip of the pencil, the lead will actually rotate, resulting in prevention of the lead to becoming flat on any side. For a student like myself who religiously relies on the usage of mechanical pencils for notes, assignments, homework, and exams, this prevention is a blessing since it prevents me from becoming frustrated when I realised that my writing is no longer small and I cannot fit a bunch of information onto one line.

    	It should be noted that the Kuru Toga's mechanism results in some give of the tip and lead when writing, which is annoying for sensitive writers. However, I don't find this to be an issue since I have never really felt this sensation or knew of its existence until reading reviews about this and other mechanical pencils. However, what is slightly disappointing for me is that because the mechanism only works when the tip is lifted off the writing surface and pressed again with some firm pressure, my writing style of semi-cursive at an angle results in the mechanism to not always work at full efficiency. Overall, this isn't a major issue, since the mechanism does still prevent the lead from having flat and dull sides, so top marks!
