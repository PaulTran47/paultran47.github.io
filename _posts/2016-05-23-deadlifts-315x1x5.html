        <p>Apologises for the poor video quality; the video was literally sent to me via a text message. Regardless, you can see my deadlifting journey here progressed from the goal of three plates to obtaining a membership of the four-plate club (415 pounds). Form here is decent, though I do remember this set being a struggle to lock out confidently towards the last two reps. Oh well, I put in the work at least, and it counts out of competition.</p>
