    	<span class="firstcharacter">M</span>y mindset has always been attracted towards mathematics, even as I became a Pomona College first year and Sagehen for the first time ever back in September of 2013. It was because of this uncertainty that I immediately declared as a Mathematics major during the same year. However, what caught me off-guard, and what I completely owe to Pomona's constant advocacy and encouragement of a liberal arts education, was my attraction towards economics as my time at Pomona College progressed. To be honest with you guys in the internet, I did not come into Pomona knowing I would declare Mathematical Economics as my second major; I certainly did not know that I would inevitably move away towards purely mathematics and towards more economics. However, double major I became, and soon before I knew it, I had emersed myself into the world of economics from the Lucas Islands Model to everyone's favourite IS-LM curve.

    	As I took more courses in economics and expanded my knowledge within the field and its uses of mathematics, I immediately became fascinated with the importance and power of the Federal Reserve upon not only the U.S. economy, but of the world economy itself. With the countless brilliant minds of economists working together to implement correct monetary policy, I began to dream of myself working at the Federal Reserve one day, and to perhaps one day get the chance to assist the economy and have some impact on the Federal Reserve's monetary policies.

    	It was this mindset, and with the guidance and advice from Professors Michael Kuehlwein, Pierangelo De Pace, and Michelle Zemel, that I applied for a research assistantship at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., the main entity of the U.S. central bank. Even after countless hours of reviewing economic concepts and theories; practising my interviewing skills; and trying to understand my deep self and desire to work at the Fed, I still had no idea what was going to happen with me and my application. Combined with how the Federal Reserve Board only hires 20-30 research assistants every year, it would be a lie to say I wasn't anxious and not thinking of the sheer number of applicants besides myself. However, even with my anxiety, I flew out to D.C., a city I have never been to before, to interview with place I dream of working at.

        Walking through the security gates of the Fed Board and looking around was like walking into a dream. The atmosphere within the building just felt of power and intelligence, which would make sense, as nearly every office had a name tag with the words "PhD" inscribed on it. I guess this sense of awe helped calm my anxiety, as my interview with the four economists interviewing me felt more like an interesting conversation personally. Furthermore, I got more excited as I talked more with them. That must be a good sign, right?

        Long story aside, it is for this reason and sign that I am writing this blog post today with a sense of pure joy. It is on this day that I received a phone call and email from the Fed Board offering my an official research asssistantship position at the Board, and it is on this day that I accepted the offer immediately. Starting next summer of 2017, I will officially be graduating from Pomona College with two Bachelors of Arts in both Mathematics and Mathematical Economics, and will be an Economics Research Assistant for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) in Washington, D.C. Starting next summer of 2017, I will be taking my first step towards becoming an economist, and achieving my academic dream.
