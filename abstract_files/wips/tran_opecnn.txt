This paper shows that the text of OPEC communication affect oil supply expectations, oil prices, and the macroeconomy over and above the effects of setting production limits. I create a new oil supply shock series from the text of OPEC communication that isolates variation in supply expectations net of confounding factors using neural network methods. My ``text shock'' correlates with about 47% of the observed variation in oil futures prices. Impulse responses from vector autoregressions using my shock display larger, adverse macroeconomic effects than estimated effects from models using changes in oil futures prices as a proxy for supply expectations.
