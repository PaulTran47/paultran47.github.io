This paper shows that the wording of OPEC communication affects oil supply expectations, oil prices, and the macroeconomy beyond the effects of setting production limits and changing current production. Using neural network methods for text analysis, I create a new oil supply expectations "text shock" from OPEC statements that is derived from variation in oil futures prices purified of noise, demand information, and endogenous responses to global economic activity. The "purified surprises" from the network correlate with 74% of the observed variation in oil futures prices. The impulse response, from vector autoregressions using my shock, of world production are more severe and immediate than previously reported. The response of the U.S. unemployment rate also no longer declines on impact. Lastly, responses of other macroeconomic and oil market variables are consistent with theory.
