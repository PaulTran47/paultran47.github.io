This paper shows that the wording of OPEC communications affect oil supply expectations, oil prices, and the macroeconomy beyond the effects of setting production limits. I create a new oil supply expectations "text shock" from OPEC statements that isolates variation in supply expectations net of demand information and endogenous responses using neural network methods. Predictions from the network correlate with 74% of the observed variation in oil futures prices. Impulse responses, from vector autoregressions using my shock, of world production are more severe and immediate than previously reported. Responses of the U.S. unemployment rate no longer decline on impact.
