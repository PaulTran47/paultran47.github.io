This paper shows that the wording of OPEC communication affects oil supply expectations, oil prices, and the macroeconomy beyond the effects of setting production limits. Using neural network methods for text analysis, I create a new oil supply expectations "text shock" from OPEC statements that purifies variation in oil futures prices of demand information and endogenous responses to global economic activity. The "purified surprises" from the network correlate with 74% of the observed variation in oil futures prices. Impulse responses, from vector autoregressions using my shock, of world production are more severe and immediate than previously reported. Responses of the U.S. unemployment rate no longer decline on impact. Responses of other macroeconomic and oil market variables are also consistent with theory.
