Repository hosting all assets and source code for the website showing the internet who I am.

Happy to say I coded this from scratch using only vanilla HTML5/CSS/JS, so my website's source code should be understandable to all programmers.

That's basically it.

# Website entirely responsive
=========================================================================

As of 21 October, 2021, the home page is now completely scaled for almost all common, non-desktop display resolutions (i.e., the home page is unscrollable and its entire contents can be viewed as is). This includes screens as small as the iPhone 4 to as large as the iPad Pro. Uncommon display resolutions such as the Galaxy Fold, Surface Duo, and Nest Hub are also supported.

Only resolutions with heights less than that of the iPhone 4 will result in content being scrollable. This was a conscious decision made, as shrinking the content small enough to fit would result in said content to be unreadable or crash into each other.

Every other page design remains responsive since day one.
