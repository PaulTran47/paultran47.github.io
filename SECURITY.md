# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Although I created my personal website entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS
with the full intention of securing both my and visitors' personal data (i.e.,
through both the source code and usage of Cloudflare resources), there is always
the possibility that I have made coding mistakes somewhere along the way that
causes my website to disclose vulnerabilities.

In the event that a vulnerability/error/mistake has been discovered about my
website, please [submit an issue to the GitHub repo](https://github.com/paultran47/paultran47.github.io/issues).
I will then address the problem as soon as possible.
